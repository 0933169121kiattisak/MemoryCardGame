# Let me explain the core concepts of this memory card game:
1. Core Game Concepts
   - The game consists of pairs of matching cards that are initially face down
   - Players flip two cards at a time trying to find matches
   - When a match is found, cards stay face up
   - Game ends when all pairs are matched
2. Key Data Structures
   ```  const emojis = ['🐶', '🐱', '🐭', '🐹', '🐰', '🦊', '🐻', '🐼'];  // Base emoji set
       let cards = [...emojis, ...emojis];  // Doubled to create pairs
      let flippedCards = [];  // Tracks currently flipped cards
   ```
